# Contributor Code of Conduct(English)
[［简体中文］](CODE_OF_CONDUCT_ZH_CN.md)
[［繁體中文］](CODE_OF_CONDUCT_ZH_TW.md)

We, the contributors and maintainers of the HyperLightBCL project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of experience level, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the project, including GitHub issues, pull requests, mailing lists, chat channels, and in-person events.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Derogatory comments, personal insults, or sustained disruption of discussions
- Publishing others' private information without explicit consent
- Unwanted sexual attention
- Deliberate misuse of issue trackers, PRs, or channels to harass or target individuals

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at `dcrstudio@yeah.net` or by opening a confidential support request (if available). Provide as much detail as possible, including links, screenshots, and timestamps.

All reports will be handled promptly and with discretion. The maintainers will review reports and may take actions including but not limited to:

- Asking the offending party to stop the behavior
- Removing or editing offending comments or content
- Temporarily or permanently banning a user from project channels
- Forwarding details to appropriate authorities in cases of threat or illegal activity

Maintainers who receive a report will recuse themselves from discussions where they have a conflict of interest and will seek input from other maintainers or community members when needed.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual's actions can reasonably be considered to affect the project or its community. Examples include public social media posts that reference the project or contributors, blog posts, and conference behavior when representing HyperLightBCL.
